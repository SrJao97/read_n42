"""
Description:
This file was developed for converting N42 NIST files to CSV format, specifically tailored for gamma-ray spectrometry spectra obtained with an H3D M400 CZT detector.

The script extracts PUR, INDIV, and SINGLE spectra from N42 files and adds them to separate columns in the CSV. Python 3 and libraries "os", "pandas", "numpy", and "BeautifulSoup" are required.

Execution is possible via Terminal/CMD or Python editors like VSCode or Sublime Text.
